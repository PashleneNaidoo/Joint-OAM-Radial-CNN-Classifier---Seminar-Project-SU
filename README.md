This study compares single-head and multi-head CNNs for joint classification of orbital angular momentum (l) and radial (p) indices in turbulence-distorted Laguerre-Gaussian beams using intensity-only inputs from a simulated 40-class dataset. Joint accuracies for both the single-head and multi-head CNNS reach a 93% accuracy, with p highly robust (>99%) due to persistent rings, while l is vulnerable to scintillation.
